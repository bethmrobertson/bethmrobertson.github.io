# Hospital Data Analysis Project using MySQL

**Project Description** <br>
This analysis is from a dataset used in a study conducted in 2014 of 70,000 clinical database records.
Several different department administrators at the hospital want insights into specific parts of the data. I used MySQL to access, clean, and analyze the data.
