# NBA Project - Part II (using Excel)

**Project Description** <br>
As previously mentioned, I have a friend who spends a lot of time with the NBA. When I started the NBA project for DataCareerJumpstart, I asked my friend if he had any questions about basketball that he would like answered. He asked me two questions that I will answer in this project. I presented these answers to him when I last saw him and he said that he felt 'seen'. Mission accomplished.

**The Two Questions**

- What is the relationship between the number of 2 point shots attempted and made and 3 point shots attempted and made?
- Does home court advantage still exist?
<br>
**The Data**
<br>
To answer the first question I downloaded all of the game data from 1946-47 to 2022-23 on basketball-reference.com, imported it into Excel, sorted the data by season, and found the sum of the number of **two point shots attempted** and **two point shots made** per season. From 1979 onward, I did the same thing for **three point shots**. Those are the four lines you will see in the graph.
<br>
For the second question, I downloaded the data for each game for one season every decade from 1972-73 to 2022-23. I then calculated whether the game was a home win or an away win, and summed those calculations. Out of 100% of the games each season, I looked at the **percentage of home vs away wins**. Once I looked at the graph for each decade, I noticed that there seemed to be a **decline in the percentage of home games won since 2012**. So I download the data for each season from 2012-13 to 2022-23 and calculated home and away wins and created the same percentage graph.

**Insights**
<br>
***2 pt vs 3 pt shots attempted and made*** <br>

Two point shots attempted are still much greater than three point shots attempted by a large margin. But the slope of the two point shots attempted is decreasing and the slope of the three point shots attempted is increasing. I analyzed the slopes of those lines and projected when they would cross, given that nothing changes. The answer is that the number of three point shots attempted will be greater than the number of two point shots attempted in 2042, 64 years after the implementation of the three point shot.

**Embiid had the most average points per game** and had an excellent playoff run in addition to his stellar regular season. He was the runaway choice for MVP with 73 first-place votes to Nikola Jokic's 15 first place votes. The graph below shows average points per game instead of total.

<br> ***Team Total Points*** <br>
The Scramento Kings scored the most points overall as a team in 2022-23. They made the playoffs but were knocked out by Golden State in the first round. The Kings also had five players with 1,000 points or more. Only two other teams had that same number. But, in the end, it matters in which games you score all those points!

<br>***Assists by Position***<br>
Which positions provide the most assists? **Point guards** lead the way in that category. But if you are listing leaders, you also have to include centers Jokic and Sabonis, who are assist machines.

***Who shoots the most threes?***
<br>
If you want to know which positions shoot the most three pointers for each team, here's a table for you. This would make an excellent pocket card to keep nearby for every game!

<br>
In 2022-23, teams had to watch out for Boston center, Al Horford (44.6%), and Memphis shooting guard, Luke Kennard (49.4%). They were the most accurate 3 point shooters in the league. In 2023-2024 so far, the Suns Grayson Allen is leading the way with 48.1% accuracy.

Stay tuned to this channel for the second part of my NBA study, in which I try to provide some answers to specific questions from the biggest NBA fan I know! Let me know what else **you** would like to know! 

I am looking for a full-time data analyst position, so if you know of an opportunity, please contact me. 

Thanks for reading!
