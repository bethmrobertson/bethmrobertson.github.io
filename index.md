#### [Project description] 
Our son lives on a small property on the west side of Elgin, IL. At the beginning of August, he received the electricity bill for July. It was almost $400! We were fairly shocked! We live in Houston, TX and it was a blazing-hot summer here. N's house is 2100 sq. ft. and ours is 2800 sq. ft. Our July bill was nowhere near $400. So I decided to analyze the data to see why his bill was so much higher than ours.

In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze the State of Massachusetts education data. The main focuses were:
What schools are struggling the most?
How does class size affect college admission?
What are the top math schools in the state?
