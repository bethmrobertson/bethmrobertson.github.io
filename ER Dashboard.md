I attended an Excel project development session with Chris French last week. We created a dashboard related to data from a hospital emergency room. 

I learned so much about creating a dashboard in Excel!! I was so enthusiastic, that I decided to take the project further and make it my own. Below you will find my project and some of the learnings I picked up along the way.
